-Add transparency for a selected chip
-Test how the chips move
- Allow the chips to hop each other.
-update the name of the blue chip throughout the program

-need to allow reselect when a player is going (if he selects one chip he can reselect a different chip on the same turn)

add transparent options to the enum of the board and then use the current cords to set that to transparent
**must reset it when either a chip is moved or a different chip is selected




--allow deselection of chips
--allow double hops if available

reselect logic:

if currently selected:
	call select chip 
	if select = true:
		call validate move logic
	else:
		regular validate move logic
